Thanks for wanting to contribute!

Guidelines
- Keep changes small and focused. One feature or fix per PR.
- Add or update tests for any behavior change.
- Follow the existing code style; run `npm run lint` after installing dev dependencies.
- For security-sensitive changes (detection logic, punycode), prefer an issue first to discuss.

Submitting a PR
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Commit changes with clear messages.
3. Open a PR against `main` and reference any related issues.
