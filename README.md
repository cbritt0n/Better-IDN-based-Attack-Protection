# Better-IDN-based-Attack-Protection
This Chrome Extension will provide better protections against IDN-based Phishing attacks. 

The goal with this project is to mimic Chrome's current protections against IDN-based attacks and combine those protections with the recommended protections listed in https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21summer_hu-hang.pdf.

This project is being used as a final project in the Spring 2021 CSCI 8240: Software Security Cyber Forensics under the advisement of Dr. Kyu Hyung Lee in the Department of Computer Science (https://cs.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia (https://www.uga.edu/). 

Currently, this project currently supports 65,533 of the most common Unicode characters contained in 88 of the most common Unicode Character Ranges.
