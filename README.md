# Better-IDN-based-Attack-Protection
This Chrome Extension will provide better protections against IDN-based Phishing attacks. The goal with this project is to mimic Chrome's current protections against IDN-based attacks and combine those protections with the recommended protections listed in https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21summer_hu-hang.pdf.
